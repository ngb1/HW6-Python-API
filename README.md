# HW6-Python-API

## WeatherPy

In this example, I created a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. To accomplish this, I used a simple Python library, the OpenWeatherMap API, and a little common sense to create a representative model of weather across world cities.

My objective was to build a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:


Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude


My final notebook:


Randomly selected at least 500 unique (non-repeat) cities based on latitude and longitude.
Performed a weather check on each of the cities using a series of successive API calls.
Included a print log of each city as it's being processed with the city number and city name.
Saved both a CSV of all data retrieved and png images for each scatter plot.


As final considerations:


I completed the analysis using a Jupyter notebook.
I used the Matplotlib or Pandas plotting libraries.
I included a written description of three observable trends based on the data.
I used proper labeling of your plots, including aspects like: Plot Titles (with date of analysis) and Axes Labels.


## Conclusions

After completing the WeatherPy data analysis I could determine the following trends below:
